# WordsGame

WordsGame is an Android application developed with Android Studio that aims to improve a child's English vocabulary through a fun and interactive word completion game. In this game, users can choose from three different levels, each requiring them to fill in the gaps with letters to complete a word. Level 1 consists of four-letter words, Level 2 contains five-letter words, and Level 3 presents six-letter words. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for downloading, installing, and playing the game.

## Features

- **Three Difficulty Levels**: Choose from three levels of increasing difficulty to challenge and engage the child.

- **Word Completion Game**: Fill in the gaps with letters to complete the given word.

- **Vocabulary Building**: Enhance the child's English vocabulary by practicing and learning new words.
